<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Geomembrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extrusion</li><li>Calendering</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>HDPE geomembrane is a type of synthetic liner used in various applications like landfill, mining, and agriculture to prevent fluid migration. It is manufactured through two different processes - extrusion and calendering. Extrusion involves melting and shaping the HDPE material into a continuous sheet, offering excellent consistency and flexibility. On the other hand, calendering involves passing the material through heated rollers to create a sheet, providing increased strength and durability. Both extrusion and calendering methods play a significant role in meeting the diverse needs of the HDPE geomembrane market.</p></p>
