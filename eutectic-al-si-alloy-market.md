<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eutectic Al-Si Alloy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Eutectic</li><li>Hypereutectic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Eutectic Al-Si alloys are widely used in various industries due to their excellent mechanical properties. There are two main types of Eutectic Al-Si alloys: Single Eutectic and Hypereutectic. The Single Eutectic alloy contains only one eutectic phase, which forms at the eutectic composition. This alloy offers good strength and ductility. On the other hand, the Hypereutectic alloy contains an excess amount of silicon, resulting in the formation of primary silicon particles. This alloy offers enhanced wear resistance and high thermal conductivity compared to the Single Eutectic alloy.</p></p>
