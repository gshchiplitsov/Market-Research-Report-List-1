<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium Disilicate Blocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Translucency</li><li>Medium Translucency</li><li>Low Translucency</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lithium disilicate blocks are used in the dental industry for fabricating dental restorations like crowns and veneers. These blocks come in different translucency types, namely high, medium, and low. High translucency blocks have a higher level of transparency, allowing more light to pass through, resulting in a more natural appearance. Medium translucency blocks offer a balanced level of transparency, suitable for a wide range of applications. Low translucency blocks have reduced transparency, ideal for creating highly opaque restorations, such as bridges or implants.</p></p>
