<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Compensated Dropper Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface Drip Irrigation</li><li>Subsurface Drip Irrigation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pressure Compensated Dropper Tape is a type of irrigation system used in agriculture. It consists of small tubes with evenly spaced droppers that deliver water directly to plant roots. Surface Drip Irrigation involves placing the dropper tape on the soil surface, allowing water to be distributed above ground. Subsurface Drip Irrigation, on the other hand, involves burying the dropper tape below the soil surface, delivering water directly to the roots underground. Both methods help conserve water and provide efficient irrigation for crops.</p></p>
