<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicles (EVs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>BEV</li><li>PHEV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) are categorized into two main types - Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs rely solely on an electric battery for power and do not have a backup internal combustion engine. PHEVs, on the other hand, have both an electric battery and an internal combustion engine, providing flexibility and extended range. Both BEVs and PHEVs contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels, offering environmentally-friendly alternatives to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.</p></p>
