<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Densitometers(BDM) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial BDM</li><li>Peripheral BDM</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone densitometers (BDM) are medical devices used to measure bone mineral density. There are two main types of BDMs: axial BDM and peripheral BDM. Axial BDMs are designed to measure bone density in the central skeleton, including the hip and spine. They use dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) technology. On the other hand, peripheral BDMs focus on measuring bone density in peripheral sites like the forearm, wrist, or heel. They use pDXA technology or quantitative ultrasound (QUS) to assess bone health. Both types play a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring conditions like osteoporosis.</p></p>
