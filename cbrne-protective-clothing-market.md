<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CBRNe Protective Clothing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gas Tight</li><li>Gas Permeable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>CBRNe protective clothing market includes two types: gas-tight clothing and gas-permeable clothing. Gas-tight clothing refers to garments that form a complete barrier against gases, preventing them from permeating through the fabric. This type of clothing provides high protection for individuals working in highly hazardous environments, as it prevents any contact with harmful substances. On the other hand, gas-permeable clothing allows gases to pass through the fabric but provides protection against liquid chemicals and particles. This type of clothing ensures breathability for users while still offering a certain level of protection.</p></p>
