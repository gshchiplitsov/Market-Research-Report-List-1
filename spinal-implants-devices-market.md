<p><strong>The Spinal Implants Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Spine Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The spinal implants devices market is used in open spine surgery and minimally invasive spine surgery procedures. Open spine surgery involves a traditional approach with a larger incision, providing direct access to the spine for implanting devices. On the other hand, minimally invasive spine surgery uses smaller incisions and specialized instruments to access the spine, reducing trauma and leading to faster recovery. Both approaches utilize spinal implants devices to stabilize the spine, treat spinal deformities, and provide support during the healing process.</p></p>
