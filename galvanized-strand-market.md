<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Strand Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro Galvanized Strand</li><li>Hot-Dip Galvanized Strand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The galvanized strand market consists of two main types: electro galvanized strand and hot-dip galvanized strand. Electro galvanized strand is a process in which a thin layer of zinc is applied on the strand through electroplating, providing it with a protective coating against corrosion. On the other hand, hot-dip galvanized strand involves immersing the strand in a bath of molten zinc, creating a thicker and more durable coating. Both types of galvanized strand are commonly used in industries such as construction and agriculture for their corrosion resistance properties.</p></p>
