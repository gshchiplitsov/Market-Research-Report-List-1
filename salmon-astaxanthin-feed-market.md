This has further contributed to the popularity of salmon fed with astaxanthin feed.</p><p>Additionally, the market is witnessing technological advancements in feed manufacturing processes, which are enabling the production of high-quality astaxanthin feed. These advancements ensure that farmed salmon receive the necessary amount of astaxanthin to develop vibrant colors and obtain optimal growth.</p><p>The future outlook of the Salmon Astaxanthin Feed Market remains positive. The increasing global population, rising disposable incomes, and changing dietary preferences towards seafood are expected to drive the demand for farmed salmon. The growing awareness about the health benefits of astaxanthin and the demand for naturally colored salmon will further boost market growth.</p><p>According to the provided information, the market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% during the forecasted period.
