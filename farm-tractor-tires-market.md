<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Farm Tractor Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias-ply Tires</li><li>Radial-ply Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Farm tractor tires can be classified into two main types: bias-ply tires and radial-ply tires. Bias-ply tires are constructed with multiple layers of crisscrossed fabric cords, resulting in a more flexible sidewall. They are known for providing a smooth ride and have good flotation characteristics. On the other hand, radial-ply tires have a structure where the plies are laid radially from bead to bead. They offer better traction, fuel efficiency, and longer tread life compared to bias-ply tires. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the farmers.</p></p>
