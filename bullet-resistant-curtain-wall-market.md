<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bullet Resistant Curtain Wall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unitized Curtain Wall</li><li>Stick Curtain Wall</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The bullet resistant curtain wall market consists of two main types: unitized curtain wall and stick curtain wall. Unitized curtain wall refers to a type of curtain wall system where large pre-fabricated panels are assembled off-site and then installed as a unit on the building. This method allows for a faster installation process. On the other hand, stick curtain wall is an installation method where the components of the curtain wall are individually assembled on-site. This method provides more flexibility in design and modifications. Both types offer bullet-resistant properties to enhance building security.</p></p>
