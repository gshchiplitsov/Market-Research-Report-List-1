<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suction Irrigator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-use</li><li>Reusable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suction irrigator market can be divided into two types: single-use and reusable. Single-use suction irrigators are designed to be used only once and then discarded, ensuring a sterile and hygienic procedure each time. Reusable suction irrigators, on the other hand, are made from durable materials and can be sterilized and used multiple times before disposal. Both options provide effective suction for irrigating wounds or body cavities, but single-use irrigators eliminate the need for sterilization and reduce the risk of cross-contamination.</p></p>
