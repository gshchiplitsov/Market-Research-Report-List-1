<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neonatal ICU ventilators are devices used to assist newborns in breathing when they have respiratory problems. The market for these ventilators can be divided into two types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators involve the insertion of a tube into the baby's airway, providing direct support for breathing. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver breathing support through a mask placed on the baby's face or nose, without the need for intubation. Both types aim to help newborns with breathing difficulties, but they differ in the method of delivery.</p></p>
