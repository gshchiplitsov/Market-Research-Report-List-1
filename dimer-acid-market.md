<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dimer Acid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Industrial Dimer Acid</li><li>Distilled Dimer Acid</li><li>Hydrogenated Dimer Acid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dimer acid market can be divided into three main types: Industrial dimer acid, Distilled dimer acid, and Hydrogenated dimer acid. Industrial dimer acid is obtained directly from the dimerization of unsaturated fatty acids, typically derived from vegetable oil. It is used in industries such as adhesives, coatings, and lubricants. Distilled dimer acid refers to the purification process where impurities are removed through distillation, resulting in a higher-purity product. Hydrogenated dimer acid is a further processed form of distilled dimer acid, where hydrogenation of double bonds reduces reactivity and improves stability for applications like resins.</p></p>
