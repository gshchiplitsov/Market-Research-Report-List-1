<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial vehicle tire market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed using a radial ply design, where the cords run perpendicular to the direction of travel. They offer advantages like better fuel efficiency, increased driving comfort, and longer durability. On the other hand, bias tires are built with multiple layers of ply cords that crisscross at an angle to the tire's centerline. They are known for their robustness, excellent load-carrying capacity, and resistance to cuts and punctures. Both types cater to the diverse needs of commercial vehicles, but vary in terms of construction and performance characteristics.</p></p>
