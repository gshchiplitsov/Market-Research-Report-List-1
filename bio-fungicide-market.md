<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-Fungicide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microbial</li><li>Botanical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bio-fungicide market consists of two main types: microbial and botanical. Microbial bio-fungicides are derived from living organisms such as bacteria and fungi, which can suppress or eliminate fungal plant diseases. They work by competing with or attacking the pathogens. On the other hand, botanical bio-fungicides are plant-based products that use natural compounds like oils, extracts, or enzymes to control fungal infections. These bio-fungicides provide an alternative to chemical fungicides, offering environmentally friendly and sustainable options for managing fungal diseases in agriculture and horticulture.</p></p>
