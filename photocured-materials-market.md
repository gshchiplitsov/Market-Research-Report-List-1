<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photocured Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free-radical Type Photoinitiator</li><li>Cationic Type Photoinitiator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The photocured materials market includes two main types of photoinitiators: free-radical type and cationic type. Free-radical type photoinitiators initiate the curing process by forming highly reactive free radicals when exposed to light, which can initiate polymerization reactions in various materials. On the other hand, cationic type photoinitiators work by generating acids when exposed to light, which enables the curing process in specific materials. Both types play a crucial role in the photocuring process, leading to the development and production of various cured materials in industries such as coatings, adhesives, and electronics.</p></p>
