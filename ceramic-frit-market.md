<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Frit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Leaded Frit</li><li>Lead-Free Frit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ceramic frit is categorized into two types: leaded frit and lead-free frit. Leaded frit contains lead as a key component, which helps in enhancing the properties of ceramic glazes, such as durability and opacity. However, due to health and environmental concerns, there has been a shift towards lead-free frit. Lead-free frit offers similar performance characteristics as leaded frit but is formulated without the use of lead, making it safer for both individuals and the environment.</p></p>
