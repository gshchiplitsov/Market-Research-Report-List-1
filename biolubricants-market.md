<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biolubricants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vegetable Oil</li><li>Animal Oil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biolubricants are classified into two major types - vegetable oil and animal oil. Vegetable oil-based biolubricants are derived from plants such as sunflower, rapeseed, soybean, and palm. They offer excellent lubrication properties, good viscosity stability, and high oxidative stability. Animal oil-based biolubricants, on the other hand, are obtained from animal fats and can include sources like fish and marine animals. These biolubricants possess good thermal stability and anti-wear properties. Both vegetable oil and animal oil-based biolubricants are sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based lubricants, as they are renewable and biodegradable.</p></p>
