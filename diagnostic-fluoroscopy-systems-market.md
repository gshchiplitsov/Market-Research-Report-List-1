<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diagnostic Fluoroscopy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With C-arm</li><li>With Table</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Diagnostic fluoroscopy systems are medical imaging devices that use X-ray technology to produce real-time images of the internal structures of the body. There are two main types of diagnostic fluoroscopy systems: with C-arm and with table. With C-arm systems, the X-ray source and detector are mounted on a C-shaped arm, allowing for flexible positioning around the patient. With table systems, the patient lies on a table that can be adjusted and moved to capture images from different angles. Both types of systems provide invaluable assistance in diagnosing and guiding complex medical procedures.</p></p>
