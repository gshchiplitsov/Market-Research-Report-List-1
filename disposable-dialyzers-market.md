<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Dialyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membrane</li><li>High Flux Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Disposable dialyzers are used in the treatment of kidney failure by removing waste and excess fluids from the blood. Low flux membrane dialyzers have a slower filtration rate and are suitable for patients with less severe kidney disease. High flux membrane dialyzers have a faster filtration rate and are recommended for patients with more advanced kidney disease. Both types are disposable, meaning they are used only once and then discarded. This ensures clean and efficient treatment for each patient, reducing the risk of infection and improving overall dialysis effectiveness.</p></p>
