<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoinitiators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cationic Photoinitiator</li><li>Free Radical Photoinitiator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Photoinitiators are compounds used in the process of photopolymerization. Cationic photoinitiators initiate polymerization by releasing cations when exposed to light, leading to the formation of strong and rigid polymers. On the other hand, free radical photoinitiators separate free radicals upon light exposure, which then react with monomers to create flexible polymers. Both types are widely used in various industries like printing, paints, adhesives, and electronics. Their applications depend on the desired properties of the final product, as cationic initiators provide better resistance to chemicals and higher crosslinking density, while free radical initiators offer faster polymerization and flexibility.</p></p>
