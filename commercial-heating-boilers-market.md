<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial heating boilers market comprises two main types: non-condensing boilers and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers are traditional boilers that heat water by burning fuel, but they release waste gases into the atmosphere without extracting excess heat energy. On the other hand, condensing boilers are designed to extract additional heat from the waste gases, improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These boilers are more technologically advanced and tend to have higher upfront costs but yield long-term energy savings.</p></p>
