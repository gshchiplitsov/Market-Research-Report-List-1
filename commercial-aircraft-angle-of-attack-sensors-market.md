<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Aircraft Angle of Attack Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vane angle of attack sensor</li><li>Zero pressure angle of attack sensor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The commercial aircraft angle of attack sensors market includes two main types: vane angle of attack sensor and zero pressure angle of attack sensor. A vane angle of attack sensor measures the angle between the aircraft's relative airflow and its longitudinal axis using a vane placed in the airstream. On the other hand, a zero pressure angle of attack sensor determines the angle of attack by measuring the pressure difference between two points on the aircraft's surface. Both types play a crucial role in providing accurate flight information and enhancing flight safety.</p></p>
