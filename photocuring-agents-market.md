<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photocuring Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Free-radical Type</li><li>Cationic Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Photocuring agents are compounds used in the process of photopolymerization, which is the curing or hardening of materials through exposure to light. There are two types of photocuring agents: free-radical type and cationic type. Free-radical type agents initiate the polymerization process by releasing free radicals upon exposure to light. Cationic type agents, on the other hand, initiate polymerization through the formation of cations. Both types of agents are crucial in various industries such as electronics, coatings, adhesives, and dental materials, as they promote efficient curing and improved material properties.</p></p>
