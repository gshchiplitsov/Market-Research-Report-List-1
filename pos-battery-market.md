<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The POS Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Li-Ion Batteries</li><li>Nimh</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The POS battery market offers two major types of batteries: Li-Ion batteries and Nimh batteries. Li-Ion batteries, short for Lithium-Ion batteries, are highly popular due to their high energy density, lightweight nature, and longer lifespan. They are commonly used in portable devices like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. On the other hand, Nimh batteries, or Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, provide a more cost-effective option with good energy storage capacity, but are generally heavier and have a shorter lifespan compared to Li-Ion batteries. They are commonly used in less demanding applications such as cordless phones and power tools.</p></p>
