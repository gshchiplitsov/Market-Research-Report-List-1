<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GPS Vehicle Trackers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wired</li><li>Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>GPS vehicle trackers can be divided into two types based on their power source: wired and battery-powered trackers.</p><p>Wired trackers are connected directly to the vehicle's power source and draw power from it. These trackers are typically installed permanently in the vehicle and provide continuous tracking without any need for recharging or battery replacement. They are favored in commercial fleets as they offer reliable and uninterrupted tracking capabilities.</p><p>On the other hand, battery-powered trackers are independent units that run on their internal batteries. They are easier to install as they do not require any wiring and can be placed anywhere in the vehicle. However, these trackers need periodic battery recharge or replacement, making them more suitable for personal vehicles or smaller fleets.</p></p>
