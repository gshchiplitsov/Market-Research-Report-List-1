<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Halogen-free Control Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LSZH</li><li>FRNC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The halogen-free control cable market consists of two main types: LSZH (Low Smoke Zero Halogen) and FRNC (Flame Retardant Non-Corrosive). LSZH cables are designed to limit the release of halogens and toxic gases when exposed to fire, making them ideal for applications in sensitive areas like hospitals and public places. FRNC cables, on the other hand, are flame retardant and emit low levels of smoke and corrosive gases when ignited. These cables are commonly used in industrial settings where fire safety is a concern.</p></p>
