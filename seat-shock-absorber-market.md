<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seat Shock Absorber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring</li><li>Rubber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seat shock absorber market includes two main types: spring and rubber. Spring shock absorbers consist of coiled springs that absorb and distribute the shocks experienced while seated, providing a smoother ride. Rubber shock absorbers, on the other hand, are composed of specially designed rubber materials that dampen vibrations and shocks, offering a comfortable seating experience. Both types aim to enhance comfort and reduce fatigue during long journeys, but they differ in terms of the mechanisms employed to absorb shocks and vibrations in seat applications.</p></p>
