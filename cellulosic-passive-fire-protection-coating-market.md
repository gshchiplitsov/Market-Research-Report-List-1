<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulosic Passive Fire Protection Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Based Coating</li><li>Solvent-Based Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cellulosic passive fire protection coating market includes two main types of coatings: water-based coatings and solvent-based coatings. Water-based coatings are made up of water as the main solvent, along with other additives such as binders and fire-resistant materials. They are environmentally friendly and easy to clean up. On the other hand, solvent-based coatings use organic solvents instead of water. They provide excellent adhesion and durability but may have higher levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and may require more complex cleanup processes.</p></p>
